# Bigmart---Sales-Prediction
A Machine learning project which will predict future by analyzing historical data
# BigMart Sales Prediction

This project aims to predict the sales of various products in BigMart outlets using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical sales data, we can develop a predictive model that can estimate future sales and help the company make informed business decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is provided by BigMart and consists of historical sales data for different products across multiple stores. It includes various features such as item weight, item visibility, item type, store size, and more. The dataset is split into a training set (`train.csv`) and a test set (`test.csv`).

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- `src/`: This directory contains Python scripts and modules for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `models/`: This directory is used to store trained model files.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the required Python libraries and their versions.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/BigMart-Sales-Prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd BigMart-Sales-Prediction`
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Ensure that the dataset files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`) are placed in the `data/` directory.
2. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to understand the data, perform preprocessing, and train the model.
3. Alternatively, run the `train.py` script in the `src/` directory to train the model using default parameters.
4. Once the model is trained, you can use the `predict.py` script to generate predictions for the test set.
5. The predicted sales output will be saved as a CSV file.

## Results

We evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE). The goal is to minimize these metrics and achieve accurate sales predictions.
